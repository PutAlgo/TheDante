RULES TO FOLLOW:


Context for what to look for when trying to identify fraudulent behavior:

Item 1: Business: This is a high-level summary of the company's operations. It can help you understand how the company recognizes revenue and what risks it faces.
Item 6: Selected Financial Data: This section provides a five-year summary of selected financial data that can help you spot trends or abrupt changes.
Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A): The MD&A is where the company explains its financial results. You might find discussions about revenue recognition policies and any changes to them.
Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data: This is the core of the 10-K. Look at the footnotes to the financial statements, which often have detailed information about revenue recognition.
Item 9: Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure: This could indicate disagreements over revenue recognition or other accounting issues.
Here are some more specific tags or red flags to look for in these sections:

Quantitative Analysis:
Revenue Recognition Policy: The model should extract the revenue recognition policy detailed in the footnotes of the financial statements. Changes in these policies over time could indicate potential red flags.
Accounts Receivable: Identify the growth rate of accounts receivable versus the growth rate of sales. If accounts receivable are growing significantly faster than sales, this could indicate premature revenue recognition.
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO): Calculate the DSO for each period and identify significant increases. This might indicate potential issues with revenue recognition.
Deferred Revenue: Look for sharp increases or decreases in deferred revenue which could indicate manipulation.
Gross Margin Trends: Calculate the gross margin for each period and identify substantial increases without a reasonable explanation.
Revenue vs. Cash Flows from Operations: If there's a significant disparity between the growth of revenue and cash flows from operations, it can be a warning sign.

Qualitative Analysis:
Changes in Revenue Recognition Policies: Extract information about changes in revenue recognition policies and the reasons given for these changes.
Returns and Allowances: Extract information related to returns and allowances. Increasing trends in returns and allowances could indicate issues with premature revenue recognition.
Audit Opinion: Extract the auditor's opinion and identify any qualifications or notes about the revenue recognition.
Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A): Analyze the language and tone used in the MD&A. Changes in tone or language could indicate potential issues. Look for certain phrases like "aggressive revenue recognition", "change in revenue estimation", or "shift in revenue policy".
Legal Proceedings and Contingencies: Extract details of any legal proceedings and contingencies related to revenue recognition, which could be indicative of potential issues.
