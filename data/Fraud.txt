FRAUDULENT CASES by example and how to identify through the financial statements:

Under Armour, Inc. (2020): The company pulled sales forward from future quarters. This could potentially be flagged by an unexpected increase in accounts receivable or a decrease in the accounts receivable turnover ratio, indicating that the company is taking longer to collect cash from sales.
Comscore Inc. (2019): Comscore recognized revenue through non-monetary transactions, which would be flagged by a lack of corresponding increase in cash flow from operations as revenue increased.
MiMedx Group, Inc. (2020): The company recognized revenue before sales were made to end users. This would likely be signaled by a sudden increase in accounts receivable or a decrease in the accounts receivable turnover ratio.
Luckin Coffee (2020): The company fabricated transactions. This fraud would be extremely difficult to detect using financial statement analysis, as the fraudulent transactions were created to align with real financial ratios.
General Electric (2020): The company made misleading statements about its power and insurance businesses. These misstatements might have been flagged by an analysis of segment revenues and profits compared to prior periods or to industry peers.
Fiat Chrysler (2020): To artificially inflate sales figures, the company maintained a 'cookie jar' of unreported vehicle sales. Unusual sales growth compared to industry peers or inconsistent growth between revenue and cash from operations might signal such practices.
BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (2018): BlueLinx failed to account properly for a large inventory purchase transaction, overestimating net income. A sudden change in inventory turnover ratio (Cost of Goods Sold/Inventory) or an unexpected increase in gross margin (Sales - COGS/Sales) might raise suspicions.
Scientific Games Corporation (2020): The company understated contract costs to inflate profits. A sudden increase in profit margin compared to previous periods or industry averages could be a red flag.
Bausch Health (2020): Bausch recognized revenue before the drugs were sold to end customers, artificially boosting sales. This might be indicated by a rapid increase in accounts receivable, a drop in the accounts receivable turnover ratio, or a lack of corresponding cash flow increase.
Revlon, Inc. (2020): Revlon ring-fenced assets during a 'going private' transaction. This could be signaled by sudden changes in asset values, unexplained increases in liabilities, or sudden increases in the current or quick ratio.
